    "A data type called a string is used to represent a string of characters. Textual data is frequently stored and altered using this technique. The standard method for enclosing strings is with quotation marks, either single ('') or double (\"\"). A variable, on the other hand, is a named area of computer memory that stores a value. Strings and other types of data of all kinds are stored and processed using it. During the running of a program, variables are used to store various types of data. They may be given a value, and as the program runs, that value may change. ."

Calculations, string concatenation, function calls, and comparisons are a few examples of expressions. \n",
