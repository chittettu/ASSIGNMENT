    "# 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Reusability: Using functions, you can enclose a section of code that completes a particular task. The ability to reuse that code in various areas of your program or in other programs is facilitated by this. You can call the function whenever you need to complete that task rather than writing the same code more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions encourage modularity by dividing a program into more manageable, independent units of code. Each function can concentrate on a particular task or functionality, which improves the program's overall organization and clarity. Additionally, modularity fosters independence among team members so that collaboration and code maintenance are improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions make abstraction possible by concealing the specifics of how a task is implemented behind a function interface. You don't need to understand how a function internally completes the task in order to call it; all you need to know is what inputs and outputs it expects. This abstraction facilitates readability of the code and makes program development easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Code reuse and maintenance: You can create reusable code blocks that can be called repeatedly by using functions. You only have to alter the function's implementation once to make changes or fix a bug, and all the places where the function is used will immediately take those changes into account. This greatly reduces the complexity of code maintenance and the likelihood of error introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and organization: Functions assist in the logical organization of code. You can make your code easier to read by decomposing larger programs into smaller functions. Because each function serves a particular purpose, it is simpler to comprehend the program's overall layout and flow. Code that is clear and well-organized is easier to maintain and less likely to contain errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing and debugging are made simpler by the use of functions. Functions can be tested independently because they are modular and encapsulated, which makes it simpler to isolate and spot problems. Additionally, functions with clearly defined inputs and outputs are amenable to automated testing, which can help to ensure that your program is correct.\n",

    "Inaccessibility of Variables: After a function call completes, any variables defined in the local scope are no longer accessible from outside the function. Any attempts to access these variables will fail. This is due to the fact that local variables are only valid within the confines of the function that they are defined in.\n",
