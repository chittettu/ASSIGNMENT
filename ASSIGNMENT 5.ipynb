    "Dictionary: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs that is not ordered. In a dictionary, each key is distinct and paired with a matching value. Hash tables are used by dictionaries to store and retrieve data quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "List: A list is an organised grouping of components. It supports duplication of values and can hold elements of many data kinds. A list's items are accessible by using their indices, which correspond to the list's places for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary: Because dictionaries are unordered, the order in which the key-value pairs were placed is not preserved. A dictionary's entries are stored and retrieved using their hash values rather than their insertion order.\n",
    "\n",
    "List: Lists are arranged in the same order that the components were added. A list's elements are indexed and retrieved in a certain order.\n",
